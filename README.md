# Joint Permute-and-Flip
This contains Python codes and supplemental results of our experiments on accuracy, rank error, and run time of our Joint Permute-and-Flip mechanism. 

In this study, we also proposed pseudo-SHD scores and new score function for the "joint" approach suitable for genomic statistical analysis. 

The procedure to generate simulation data for our experiments can be found in "SimulationData" folder.

In "RunTime" folder, we also provide supplemental results for the cases where $K=1$, $5$, and $7$. These results indicate that our method becomes more desirable than the normal exponential mechanism as $K$ increases. 

Coupled with the results on accuracy and rank error, our Joint Permute-and-Flip can be advisable for publishing the top $K$ significant SNPs in large-scale genomic statistical analysis.

## Note

For details of our methods and discussion, please see our paper entitled "A Joint Permute-and-Flip and Its Enhancement for Large-Scale Genomic Statistical Analysis".
